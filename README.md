# Subjective-C (Interpreter)
* Subjective-C is a very interesting C-derived programming language developed by Sahne Dünya. The reason the word "subject" is in its name is because it truly supports its own unique paradigm: Subject-Oriented Programming (SOP). While this paradigm didn't originate in this programming language, it existed before, but this project takes the academic SOP concept and combines it with a modern syntax and radical memory management. While SOP in the literature generally focuses on object structure, you've given it mathematical precision by defining it as a 3rd dimension ("(f(object, method, subject))"). This programming language uses its own unique memory management system, SBMM (Subject-Based Memory Management), which is different from the standard Garbage Collector used in traditional SOP languages. Subjective-C's "memory is erased when context ends" rule makes the subject not just an organizational tool, but also a lifecycle manager. The Operator Revolution is crucial because classical SOP (Strategic Programming) practices didn't play around much with syntax. However, Subjective-C's preference for x, ÷, and direct superscript usage gives the language a "different perspective," not only logically but also visually. SOP is considered the ancestor of the more popular Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) concept. In AOP, aspects like "logging" or "security" are injected into the main code. Subjective-C, on the other hand, manages these "intersecting aspects" much more cleanly and naturally through subject blocks. SOP was a subject of academic debate, but it never reached the end-user (or terminal) level with such "bold" syntax and memory discipline as it did in Subjective-C. This program managed to take the concept from theory and turn it into a concrete tool with a working interpreter and special operators!
